# igdeletepost

Unfortunately, there is no option to delete all posts On Instagram. If you want to get rid of everything you've ever posted on this platform, you will either need to continue doing this to each and every one of your posts.

with the help of this extension, you can delete all your posts on youtube without having to bother with manual clicks one by one. this script will do it, you just press the start button and you can let the computer work for you.
